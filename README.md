## Which is the tougher matchup? Left-Handed Pitchers(LHP) or Right-Handed Pitchers(RHP)?


For my project, I wanted to use a small data source and help answer the age old question of, "Is a LHP better than a RHP?".

In the MLB, there are substantially more RHP than there are LHP, so they are a thing of value.  Is that really relevant though? Is a LHP more fierce and efficient than a RHP? My project utilizes a few data sets to determine if LHP are better than RHP.

My first source of data was taking the actual batting averages of all 30 teams in the MLB, finding the mean and then comparing their averages to the average amongst all teams.  The results were no where near conclusive enough to be able to make that determination.  So I had to go a little further out of the box.

The second set of data that I created was a 'RunRatio' column. This uses the amount of runs that each team scored last season against the total number of hits that each team scored.. Divided the two, to come up with an average run-per-hit number.  As with the first data set, I went ahead and took the total league data and determined a league average runs-per-hit.  

 Well, according to my data set, there really isn't enough evidence to give a conclusive answer, so I would have to say that their is no big difference except for the fact of that there are not that many to choose from.
