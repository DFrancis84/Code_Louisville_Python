## Which is the tougher matchup? Left-Handed Pitchers(LHP) or Right-Handed Pitchers(RHP)?


For my project, I wanted to use a small data source and help answer the age old question of, "Is a LHP better than a RHP?".

In the MLB, there are substantially more RHP than there are LHP, so they are a thing of value.  If that really relevant though? Is a LHP more fierce and efficient than a RHP?  Well, according to my data set, there really isn't enough evidence to give a conclusive answer, so I would have to say that their is no big difference except for the fact of that there are not that many to choose from.
